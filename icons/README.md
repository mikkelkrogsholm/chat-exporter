# Icons Folder

This folder should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can:
1. Create simple placeholder PNG images with those dimensions
2. Remove the "icons" and "default_icon" sections from manifest.json if you don't want icons yet
3. Use any icon generator tool to create icons for your extension

The extension will work without these icons, but Chrome may show a default placeholder icon instead.
